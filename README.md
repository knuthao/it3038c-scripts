# it3038c-scripts

I created a python script that takes advantage of the abilities provided by NumPy. All you will need to do to be able to run the script is to run the command "pip install numpy".

The script will ask the user to identify the length and components of an array. The numpy commands then help to allow the array to be presented in numerical order and provide more information about the set of numbers entered.

Users will simply need to fillow instructions provided by the script.
