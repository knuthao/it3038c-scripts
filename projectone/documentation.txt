Documentation for lab1script.py

I created a script that prompts the user and responds based on input.

The user can use this script to find the current date, current time, or both.
    To get the time users should enter "Time"
    To get the date users should enter "Date"
    To get both users should enter "Both"

Script is case sensitive!

Any option other than "Time", "Date", or "Both" will loop the user until a valid entry is received.
